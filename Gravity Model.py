# No Convergence in the First Run
#In the first execution, the model failed to achieve an error lower than the threshold within the allowed number of iterations.
#This was due to the lack of connections between some zones, which prevented the algorithm from generating a proper trip distribution.
#The computed error value (Computed Error Value = 0.4212) confirms this issue and indicates that the problem cannot be solved with the initial parameters.
# Adjusting Deterrence for Unconnected Routes
#In the second execution, the deterrence value for unconnected routes (epsilon) was adjusted to a small value such as 10âˆ’6.
#This adjustment allowed the model to reach an error below the threshold, successfully converging after 19 iterations. However, in the final trip matrix, positive values appeared for routes without any direct connection, which invalidates the solution.
# No Valid Solution for the Problem
#The results demonstrate that with the current setup, the problem lacks a valid solution.
#Even with adjustments to the deterrence parameters, the presence of unconnected routes results in a final solution that cannot accurately reflect the true distribution of trips. 
#Assigning positive values to non-existent routes violates the logic of the model.
